# TimedServo
By calculating the time to reach the goal and adding in time segments to each degree, a servo can be made to slowly reach it's goal by having many subgoals.

This is an arduino library, that depends on the Servo library. 

To use, copy into your library folder, and restart your arduino IDE.
